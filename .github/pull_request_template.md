## Contribution Guidelines
Ensure all article submissions are pre-checked for English grammar technically accurate, and delivered under the assertion that the content is original to you and includes proper citations (including sourced images).

Before submitting your article, we request that you cross-check the readability of your content using this free tool. This check helps make your writing BOLD & CLEAR by calling attention to any lengthy, complex sentences and common errors. If you see a yellow sentence, you may want to shorten or split it.

These guidelines are intended to help EngEd contributors grow as authors and to enrich the larger engineering community as a whole by continuing to create higher quality educational articles, tutorials, how-to’s,technology reviews, etc.

Communicating your key takeaways
Articles should be clear, accurate, and fully explained. We are more interested in substance than length, and supporting examples are always encouraged. At the same time, articles that include mostly code with very little narrative lack sufficient depth and guidance for the audience to fully grasp important concepts.

We suggest you think about what is most important to your article or any pain point you are addressing. Assume the audience is smart but has no prior exposure to the common terminology in your article.

For example:
If your article is about serving ML models with Django, then the reader should have a decent understanding of something like:

The structure of a django app
How to use such an app to serve a model for inference
The details your article gives should help further grow the readers’ skills as they practice on their own projects.

**Articles should be a minimum of 750 words.**
