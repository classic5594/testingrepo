## Contribution Guidelines
Welcome to Section’s Engineering Education program. This program is dedicated to providing a community-generated pool of educational content that is useful for engineers of every level. To begin, we’d recommend reviewing our most recently published content at section.io/engineering-education/ to get a sense of:

- Article structures
- Type of content that has been contributed
- Topics you can begin working on

Articles do not need to be Section-specific or strongly Section-related. This is not necessarily about Section or Edge Compute directly, but rather an effort to provide educational value to software developers within the diverse ecosystem of web technologies. 

**Articles should be a minimum of 750 words.**
